      <ul>
        
        <li>The title of the project was <a href="Internship.pdf" <strong>Network Collusion Analysis.</strong></li></a>

        <li>Network Collusion Analysis was a client and projects I worked on. I used Python and Pyspark to clean, analyse, and build association models to identify network collusion as part of the Network Collusion project.
         I used association algorithms like Apriori and FP-growth to find network patterns.</li>
